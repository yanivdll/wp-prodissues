<p> I'm sold on it. Yeah, it might be a hasty conclusion based on less than 24 hours with it, but the Watch is here to stay. Well, probably not the exact one I used, because I passed it over to my wife, trying to get her drinking the Kool-Aid as well. </p>

<!--more-->

<p> First off, I should say that I had very low expectations. I'm not the kind of guy who's crazy about watches. I don't even know why I'm wearing one <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. I bought the Apple Watch, and did it so early, simply because I knew I <i>will</i> buy it eventually. After all, I can't resist Apple's incredible marketing machine. Forking the $350 now, I thought, will save me the agonizing deliberations and endless reading of equivocal reviews. And I'm happy I did, because I found it to be a beautiful, useful and humble timepiece. </p>

<p> Much was already written about <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/04/review-apple-watch-as-a-design-piece/">its design</a>, so there is no point for me to come up with more superlatives to describe its allure. Trust me, it looks just like in the pictures - a charming gadgety garment that will give your hand a bionic yet chichi and fashionable look. </p>

<p> Aside from design, it's surprisingly useful, exactly when you want it to. In my company we use <a href="https://www.duosecurity.com/">Duo</a> for security services. Duo has a cool feature that allows you to authenticate by responding to a push notification on your phone. As cool as this feature is, you still have to find your phone, usually scrambling to take it out of your front pocket <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Getting and accepting the request using your watch can't be more natural and convenient. </p>

<p> What strikes me the most about the Watch, though, is its humbleness. Unlike other devices, it doesn't grapple my attention. I don't turn it on 150 times a day, as I'm conditioned to with my phone. It isn't swamped with red badges that cry "tap me", and it doesn't vibrate erratically whenever my mom send a WhatsApp to a family group I've been trying to mute forever. Obviously, I can make it as obnoxious as I want by fiddling with the notification settings or loading useless apps. But out of the box it's as polite as I would have expected such a close and personal companion to be. It's like, well, a watch. You look at it when you want to. And when you do, it lits gently to share the time with you. Simple. And when it <i>does</i> have something important to say, it does it shyly and politely, using its haptic feedback. This is one of those gems that no one pay too much attention to <sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. The tactile sensation it emits is so gentle you might mistake it with a human touch. </p>

<p> The one thing that put me off was the learning curve I went through before getting what each of the knob and gesture do. I'm embarrassed to say that I had to skim through the short help-page that comes with it. That's not something I'm used to do with other Apple products. </p>

<p> But overall, I'm happy with the Watch. I think it'll be a good replacement for my current watch, and I see how it can help me break the unhealthy ties with my iPhone. Now, all I have to do is get one of my own, assuming my wife will come up with the same conclusion. </p>

<p> <b>Update</b> - She didn't. After 2 days with the watch my wife concluded that it's beautiful and humble, but not useful enough to justify the expense. </p>

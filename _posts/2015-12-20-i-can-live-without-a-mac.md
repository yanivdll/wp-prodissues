<p> Couple of months ago I listened to an episode of the <a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/080-a-history-of-computing">technical difficulties</a> podcast. In that episode Gabe Weatherhead (<a href="http://macdrifter.com/">macdrifter.com</a>) and Erik Hess hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/drdrang">Dr. Drang</a> and talked about the history of computing. </p>

<p> At some point <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, Gabe asked Dr. Drang what will he do if he can't use Mac anymore. I don't remember exactly what Dr. Drang's answer was, but for awhile, the question kept echoing in my head. The thought about Mac not being around at some point was terrifying. I can't go back to Windows. Never. And Linux never seen as an adventure I would have like taking. </p>

<p> Since then, though, much have changed. </p>

<p> At first, I was reintroduced to old fashion mechanical keyboards<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. I bought a couple of them; one for home and one for my office. Suddenly, typing using my laptop's keyboards <sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> feels awkward and unsatisfying, and I now do it as little as possible. </p>

<p> Then, I took a step into the rabbit hole of Emacs, the timeless editor which is backed by a strong and lively community. It's built around the keyboard, so I stopped using the Apple's "magic" mouse as much as I used to. </p>

<p> Lastly, since Emacs requires tinkering with Mac's internals, I got more comfortable and familiar with the terminal application, and with "UI-less" experiences. </p>

<p> Slowly, I've learned that my Mac is nothing but a strong processing device with a Retina display. With that realization, the idea of using a different platform, Windows is still not an option, stopped scaring me. To the contrary, that thought sparks curiosity in me... </p>

<p> While switching away is still not an option, I feel as if I was cured from Apple's spell. I regained my ability to think critically on its products, and look more objectively on their alternatives. </p>

<p> It's probably only me, though, <a href="http://prodissues.com/2015/11/leap-into-the-past-irc.html">cuddling with the past</a>. Most users are probably welcoming the intersecting paths of Mac and iPad into a comp-let mongrel that will lock developers out of its internals. But now, at least, I'm less anxious about that trajectory. I <i>will</i> be able to find my way elsewhere... </p>

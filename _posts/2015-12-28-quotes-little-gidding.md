<p> Couple of weeks ago I was vacationing with my family at DR. In one of the nights, at about midnight, I was lying half asleep in-front of the TV, watching some show about Vietnam in the only English channel (Discovery Channel, I remember that), while my ears caught this quote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> This line stirred me up so much, that I rose up, took my iPhone and googled the few words I was able to recall. It turned out that this line was taken from T.S Eliot's poem - <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/winter/w3206/edit/tseliotlittlegidding.html">Little Gidding</a>. The next day, I read the entire poem. It wasn't an easy read<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, but several more parts of it moved me just as much. Here are couple of them: </p>

<blockquote>
<p> ... last year's words belong to last year's language And next year's words await another voice. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p> Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age ... Second, the conscious impotence of rage At human folly, and the laceration Of laughter at what ceases to amuse. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Mysterious are the ways of knowledge and inspiration... one should always be willing and ready to absorb more of them... </p>

Now that I moved to Wordpress, I can finally set Emacs' font to Input. Wait, <em>what</em>? what does an Emacs font has to do with WordPress?

Well, in a previous post, I documented how to <a href="http://prodissues.com/2015/11/changing-the-default-font-in-emacs.html">modify fonts in Emacs</a>. However, I had to rollback the new font, because it broke Pelican's org-reader plugin, which relied on Emacs' configuration. For some reason it didn't like the new font, and decided it doesn't generate HTML files until I revert to `Menlo`.

In fact, this is one of the reasons I gave up on Pelican. It was too britle. So now that I'm on WordPress, I'm free to confugure Emacs however I want. Here's how my new font looks like:

I've just started a new meetup group in NYC. This groups is all about mechanical keyboards!&nbsp;

So if you're around (in the NYC area), if you have reminiscences to the tactile feel and click-clacky noise keyboards used to have when you were a kid, if you're already spellbound, spanding hundreds of dollars in Massdrop, if you know everything about SA and DSA, &nbsp;if you're one of the 5% who had their spacebar flipped, if you have just built your own Ergdox, or if you just want to learn what's all the fuss with those retro, charming typing devices - <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Click-clack-Mechanical-Keyboard/">join us</a>!&nbsp;

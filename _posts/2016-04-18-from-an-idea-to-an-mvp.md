So I have this <a href="http://prodissues.com/2016/03/make-food-fun-again.html">idea for food recommendation</a>, but now I'm struggling with where to start. What will be a good first usecase for a POC or MVP.

At the moment, I'm planning on a single page dashboard where users can login to, to get a report on their food ordering habits - top dishes and restaurants and more such data.

But I have are two issues with scope:
<ol class="org-ol">
	<li>Not sure users will see the value that I see in such dashboard. Now, sure, that's what the MVP is for, but:</li>
	<li>It's not testing the real product assumption that users will want to get recommendations for food.</li>
</ol>
With that in mind, I thought of two other options:
<ol class="org-ol">
	<li>Dishes following - as a user, I can follow the food that I like and see updates, recipes and places I can find them.</li>
	<li>Group ordering - offer a simple 'negotiator' for food ordering. For example, a group of 4 people who want to order lunch, will connect to this page and put their preferences. The system will match their preferences and come with a suggested restaurant. Users can then save their preferences by registering. It reminds me of <a href="http://www.doodle.com/">doodle.com</a>.</li>
</ol>
I like the other option both because it requires less technical effort - I can see how I can pull out an MVP without writing a line of code. In addition, this can turn out to be aÂ utility that users will be willing to register to. Lastly, solving for groups orders introduce the possibility for virality and network effect.

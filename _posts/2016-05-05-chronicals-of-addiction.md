6 months ago I listened to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/1">a podcast</a>, and learned for the first time about this mechanical keyboard thing.

I was intrigued and began reading about it.

3 weeks later I bought a <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/code-keyboard/code-104-key-mechanical-keyboard-1303.html">wasd code</a>.

I kinda liked it, but not that much. The blue switches, together with the thin keycaps felt flimsy and hollow. The typing experience wasn't what I imagined it to be.

More research, and I've learned about the different types of switches. I returned blues and replaced with a <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/code-keyboard/code-104-key-mechanical-keyboard-mx-green.html">tenkeyless greens</a>.

The sound and tactile feel of the green switches was better, but the typing experience still wasn't there.

I'm looking for mechs on Craigslist and find this old <a href="http://stanis.net/uvpub/omnikey102.html">Northgste keyboard</a>. I google and find its an old classic. Trying to buy it didn't work, but I'm getting hooked to old school keyboards. Shortly after, I venture with an <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II">Apple Extended Keyboard 2</a>.

The AEK2 felt like a dream. But it's 30 years old keys start to die one after the other.

I've turned into a keyboard doctor and gave it an <a href="http://prodissues.com/2016/01/fixing-my-apple-extended-keyboard-ii.html">open heart surgery</a>.

I'm delving deeper into mechs, and spend hours at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards/</a>.

I heard about Massdrop. This horrible site detached me from hundreds of dollars.

There is more to mechanical keyboards than just the switches. As it turned out keycaps is an entire area that I wasn't aware of. I'm learning about all the different profiles. SA looked awesome, but there is a Granit DSA drop in Massdrop, and I can't hold myself from committing to it.

I need to see and try more keyboards than I can buy, so I'm starting a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Click-clack-Mechanical-Keyboard/">mechanical keyboard meetup</a>.

The granit drop was closed 2 and I'm getting the keys 3 months later.

I'm swapping the crappy wasd keys, but finding that the stabilizers won't fit into the new granit keycaps, so I buy silicon tape and wrap it over the stabilizers to make it fit more closely with the new granits.

My renewed code can finally compete with the AEK2; compete but never win...

What have become of me... How have I been sucked into this world...?

Anyway, I'm starting to feel an itch for a portable mech. For travels. Going to hunt a 60% drop.

The lesson: never listen to podcasts again.

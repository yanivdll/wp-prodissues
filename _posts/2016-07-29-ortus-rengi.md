Recently I'm into gaming. It started with a nostalgic craving to Half-Life, which I used to spend hours on, about ages ago. I wondered if there's a version for mac, and found that there is, in <a href="http://steamcommunity.com">Steam</a>. I didn't hear about Steam before (thinking about it, I <em>did</em> hear about it in one of the Cortex podcast episodes), but once visiting that service, there is no way out... a spent almost the entire night browsing through games, feeling I'm in an amusement park. I forgot all about half-life, and eventually immersed myself in <a href="http://ortusregni.com">Ortus Rengi</a>, a closed-deck, deck-design strategy card game.

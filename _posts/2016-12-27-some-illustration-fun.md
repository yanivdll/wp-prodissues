I'm working on a side project - a weather app that helps parents decide on how to dress their babies. Instead of focusing on the weather data, this app will focus on translating the forecast to baby's outfit.

I found out that designers are even more expensive than developers, so I had to take a stab at doing some graphical design work... Here are some of the outcomes:

[gallery ids="929,932,933,934,935,936,937,938,939,940,941,942,943,944,945,946,947,948,949,950,951,952,954,957"]

&nbsp;

Btw, I illustrated most of these items in <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, which is basic alternative to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a>.

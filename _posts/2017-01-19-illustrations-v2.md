In an <a href="http://prodissues.com/2016/12/some-illustration-fun.html">earlier post</a> I shared some of my illustrations for <a href="http://m.me/1800370993514871">Baby Weatr</a>, a Messenger app that helps parents chose an outfit for their newborn baby based on the weather. As I gained more experience in illustrations (note: I'm not a designer), a style started to emerge. Here are the outcomes of the second iterations.

I created most of those illustrations in <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, while transitioning to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a>. Finally, I then used <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com">Sketch</a> to create complete outfits (see example at the bottom of this post).

These are the styles we're using in the app:

[gallery ids="1062,1064,1065,1066,1067,1069,1070,1071,1072,1073,1074,1075"]

&nbsp;

And here's how items then added to a complete outfit:

Tomorrow will be my last day at Outbrain. Here's my goodbye note.
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi all,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow will be my last day at Outbrain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'd like to thank you for being such an important part of my life for the last (almost) 5 years. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As there's rarely a single feature that makes a killer product, but rather a combination of capabilities, orchestrated in just the right way to help a user solve a need, the same is true now, when I look to thank the people who’ve shaped my experience at Outbrain. I can't mention just one or several people, because it's the collection of you all, creating a truly unique culture and atmosphere that makes that company so special. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm thankful for the privilege to work with and learn from you!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping in touch with many Outbrain alumni, I know that I can leave Outbrain, but the Outbrain will never leave me :)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So please don’t hesitate to keep in touch and reach out! I'll be a click of a </span><a href="http://usebutton.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">button</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> away.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks. Yaniv</span></blockquote>

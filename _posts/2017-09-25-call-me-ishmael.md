How timely... yesterday I finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27742061-moby-dick">the book</a>, and today Dropbox Paper already greeted me with this prompt:<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1179" src="http://prodissues.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-11.54.22-AM.png" alt="" width="829" height="935" />

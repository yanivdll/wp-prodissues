My memory retention for names and faces is bad, to say the least. Too often I'll have no idea if I met the person standing in-front of me before. And as for names, I'll usually have them completely wrong; not even one matching syllable. “Oh, how's Elinor is doing”, “who??”, “Elinor, who went to school with you”, “You mean Sharon”, “Oh right…”

As for names, I log the names of people I meet. But never able to retrieve them in time. 

But for faces, I did have a simple hack. When meeting someone I’m not sure I’d met before, I'll always assume that I had. I'll say something like “I believe we met before…?”

This is a probabilistic bet, with the following possible outcomes:

1. We actually didn't meet before - no bad. 
2. We did meet and he does remember - win! 
3. We did meet but she doesn't remember - bigger win!

So, it's clear that based on the expected return, the safest bet is to use the “we met before” strategy.

I wish I had better ways to retain that type of information. It would have mad me a better person…
